**Author**: Team 98

## 1 Introduction

*JobCompare: Job Offer Comparison App* is an application that compares job offers with benefits, different locations, and other aspects beyond salary. This single-user app will provide users ease as they search for new jobs.

## 2 Process Description

##### Create UML Design Document
---
*Description*: A class diagram representing the classes, attributes, functions, and relationships of the application should be created as a starting to point for this project. The diagram will help provide a picture for developers to see the contents of the application.

*Entrance Criteria*: Creation of UML class diagram using drawing tool. Collaboration of team to discuss and make adjustments (if necessary) to class diagram.

*Exit Criteria*: PDF of finalized UML design. Unanimous agreement of completion of design by team.

##### Review User Requirements
---
*Description*: Requirements of the application are met and documented. They should be discussed about and thoroughly analyzed to ensure that classes, attributes, functions, and relationships are interconnected and make sense.

*Entrance Criteria*: Collaboration of team to discuss requirements. 

*Exit Criteria*: MD file with requirements spread out as steps.

##### Document Design Discussion
---
*Description*: Document the discussion the team has during meetings and communication programs to ensure each individual developers' opinions about the overall design and pieces of design are seen. This document will provide deliberation and transparency amongst the team members. 

*Entrance Criteria*: Edits to a common document by individual group members of their pros and cons of the design thus far. Collaboration of team members to agree or disagree with documented notes.

*Exit Criteria*: MD file with each team member's opinions on the design and a summary.

##### Create Use Case Model
---
*Description*: Use case diagram with all the actors and use cases for the system, suitably connected. Each use-case will describe the application requirements, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and scenarios. 

*Entrance Criteria*: Creation of use-case diagram with drawing program. Collobration of team to discuss design and descriptions.

*Exit Criteria*:  MD file with completed Use Case Diagram and descriptions for each use-case. 

##### Create Design Document
---
*Description*: Document consisting of design considerations, architectural design, low-level design, and user interface design. Encompasses the design of this application from assumptions to a physical representation. Collaboration of team to discuss design considerations. 

*Entrance Criteria*:  Collaboration and discussion about different sections of design document. Research of system application will run on, dependencies of software, hardware software will interact with. Creation of component and deployment diagram. Creationg of class diagrams and supplement diagrams. Creationg of GUI.

*Exit Criteria*: MD file documenting initial versions of all entrance criteria parameters. 
##### Create Test Plan 
---
*Description*: Test plan includes overall strategy, test selection, adequacy criterion, bug tracking, technology, and test cases. It will be implemented to ensure that our application is running seamlessly and without problems.

*Entrance Criteria*: Collaboration of team to discuss test plans. Research of test strategies and technologies.

*Exit Criteria*: MD file that documents test strategy and test cases.

##### Revise Earlier Documents (Part 1)
---
*Description*: Revision of design document, test plan, and use case model after initial creation. This will help reinforce our understanding of the application design, holistically. 

*Entrance Criteria*: Collaboration of team to review **all** documents that were created for this application design. 

*Exit Criteria*: Team agreement of documents, plan, and actions thus far.

##### Develop Alpha/Beta Version of Application 
---
*Description*: Utilizing all documents created beforehand, start and finish prototype of *JobCompare* application. 

*Entrance Criteria*: Collaboration of team to code application. Documents for reference. Occassional team meetings.

*Exit Criteria*: Alpha/Beta version of *JobCompare* application.


##### Implement Test Plan (Initial Results)
---
*Description*: Using the test plan document, *JobCompare* should be tested from beginning to end to ensure that there are no problems and bugs while using it. If any problems arises, team should troubleshoot the cause and retest.

*Entrance Criteria*: Test plan document. Test strategy and testing technology. Team collaboration.

*Exit Criteria*: Alpha/Beta version of *JobCompare* is running seamlessly.


##### Create User Manual
---
*Description*: Manual that users can read through and use for reference to understand how the application works. The manual will be thorough and include step by step instructions and images if necessary.

*Entrance Criteria*: Application prototype created.

*Exit Criteria*: Markdown file with thoroughly written instructions.


##### Revise Earlier Documents (Part 2)
---
*Description*: Revision of design document, test plan, and use case model after initial creation. This will help reinforce our understanding of the application design, holistically. 

*Entrance Criteria*: Collaboration of team to review **all** documents that were created for this application design. 

*Exit Criteria*: Team agreement of documents, plan, and actions thus far.


##### Implement Test Plan Final Results
---
*Description*: Using the current test plan document, *JobCompare* should be tested from beginning to end to ensure that there are no problems and bugs while using it. If any problems arises, team should troubleshoot the cause and retest.

*Entrance Criteria*: Test plan document. Test strategy and testing technology. Team collaboration.

*Exit Criteria*: Alpha/Beta version of *JobCompare* is running seamlessly.

##### Finalize Application
---
*Description*: At this stage, application should be thoroughly tested. Users should be able to perform their tasks on *JobCompare* application from beginning to end without any problems. 

*Entrance Criteria*: Review of application, documents, and test cases. Team collaboration and discussion of finalized application version.

*Exit Criteria*: Unanimous agreement on fully completed application and its supporting documents.

##### Deploy Application 
---
*Description*: Application is now ready for production and use. User will be able to run it on their Android device. 

*Entrance Criteria*: Application is developed. Application is tested. Team decision on readiness.

*Exit Criteria*: Application is fully functional and running on user's Android device.
