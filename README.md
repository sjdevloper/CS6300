# CS6300 Team Project

### It is a complete team project.

- We draw the UML class diagram together. 
- Each of us gives a discussion on how the final version UML diagram works.
- We discuss how the app works by calling different functions.
- UI design and provide a prototype.

#### My final main job is to test if the product is ready for use.
